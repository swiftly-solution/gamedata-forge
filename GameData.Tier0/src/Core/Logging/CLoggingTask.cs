/// Every member is guarded, because a task is read and written from different threads by design:
/// whoever is doing the work calls <see cref="Report(double)"/>, while the terminal's redraw timer
/// reads <see cref="Label"/> and <see cref="Progress"/> on its own thread. <see cref="Progress"/> is
/// a <see cref="Nullable{T}"/> of <see cref="double"/> — two fields, not one — so an unguarded read
/// can observe the flag of one write against the value of another and render a fraction that was
/// never reported.
